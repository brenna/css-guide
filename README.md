=========

These are my own internal 'best practices' for formatting CSS. Everyone's coding style is different, so this isn't a final word, just how I prefer to do things. It's also constantly being refined, as I code more and see more code from arond the community.

Many thanks to the guides that came before mine:

A lot of my formatting is based on the [Wordpress Coding Standards docs](http://codex.wordpress.org/CSS_Coding_Standards).
I also picked up a few excellent tips from [Harry Roberts (CSS Wizardry)'s CSS Guidelines](https://github.com/csswizardry/CSS-Guidelines)
